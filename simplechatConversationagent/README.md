# Conversational Agent Explanations

This document provides explanations for the `simple_agent.py` script, which implements a conversational AI agent using LangChain.

## Imports and Setup

The script starts by importing necessary libraries:
- `langchain_openai`: For using OpenAI's language models
- `langchain_core.runnables.history`: For managing conversation history
- `langchain.memory`: For storing chat messages
- `langchain_core.prompts`: For creating prompt templates
- `dotenv`: For loading environment variables

## Environment and Model Initialization

1. Load environment variables using `load_dotenv()`.
2. Set the OpenAI API key from the environment variables.
3. Initialize the language model (LLM) using `ChatOpenAI` with specific parameters.

## Chat History Store

A simple in-memory store is created to manage multiple conversation sessions:
- `store`: A dictionary to hold chat histories for different sessions.
- `get_chat_history()`: A function to retrieve or create a chat history for a given session ID.

## Prompt Template

A prompt template is created using `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages()`. It includes:
1. A system message defining the AI's role.
2. A placeholder for conversation history.
3. The user's input.

## Chain Creation

The prompt and language model are combined into a runnable chain using the `|` operator.

## History Management

The chain is wrapped with message history management using `RunnableWithMessageHistory`. This allows the agent to maintain context across multiple interactions.

## Chat Function

The `chat_with_ai()` function is defined to:
1. Take a session ID and user input.
2. Invoke the chain with history.
3. Return the AI's response.

## Main Interaction Loop

The script includes a main loop that:
1. Initializes a session ID.
2. Continuously prompts the user for input.
3. Sends the input to the AI and prints the response.
4. Exits when the user types 'exit'.
5. Prints the entire conversation history at the end.

This implementation allows for a context-aware conversation with the AI, maintaining the chat history for each unique session.
